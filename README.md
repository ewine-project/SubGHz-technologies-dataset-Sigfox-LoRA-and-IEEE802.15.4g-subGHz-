# SubGHz technologies dataset, Sigfox, LoRA and IEEE802.15.4g (subGHz)
## Dataset description
We provide a dataset comprises of IQ samples of the three subGHz technologies including Sigfox, LoRA and IEEE 802.15.4 (subGHz). From the three technologies, 8-classes of signals were generated including, 6 classes of LoRA with spreading factors (SFs) 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 each of bandwidith 125KHz, 1 class of sigfox transmitting dynamically on the sigfox channels c0, c180,...c400 of bandwidth 100Hz, and 1 class of IEEE802.15.4g (subGHz) of bandwith 600KHz. For each signal class, the data was captured for a duration of 120 sec (120,000,000 IQ samples per class). We consider a use case in which the technologies are operating in Europe at a center frequency of 868MHz. For the sigfox case, we used a TD1207R radio as a sigfox transmitter and programmed to have a packet 

each sifox packet is of duration 2.08 sec and . For the LoRA case,
